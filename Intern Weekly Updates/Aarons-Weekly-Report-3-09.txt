I am working to formulate a Bayesian likelihood function, which (multiplied by a suitable 'prior')
we can sample with the emcee python package to estimate the uncertainty on the parameters of our
models.  (Have I stated the task correctly?)

In light of our meeting on Wednesday (3/4), I obtained Sivia's _Data Analysis_ on Friday (3/6).  I
have read the first three chapters carefully, and skimmed through chapters 4 and 5.  The second half
of the book (Advanced Topics) may not be relevant to my immediate task.  (Please tell me if I am
wrong about that.)

I think most of the confusion last week was a result of my thinking that the models we have used
(Moffat, Sersic, etc.) could be used as probability density functions to construct a likelihood
function.  I understand now that the likelihood function I am seeking will be a Gaussian pdf with
the models embedded in the exponent.
