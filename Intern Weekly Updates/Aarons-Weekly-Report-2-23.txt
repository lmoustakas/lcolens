FROM: AARON BUNCH
SUBJECT: WEEKLY REPORT (2/16-2/22)
DATE: FEBRUARY 23, 2015
CC: ANDREW ROMERO-WOLF

Here is a summary of my activities for the past week.

1. Tuesday was my first day on lab!  I went through orientation at the Education Office, and then
Andrew helped me set up network access.

2. On-line training.  I completed on-line safety, import/export, and computer security training.

3. GalSim

I am still working on plotting multiple objects in a single frame.  I imported GalSim demo9.py into 
an ipython notebook, and tried to whittle away the inessential commands and leave only the
functional core.  However, in my first attempt at this, the resulting code would not run.
According to the error messages, I am passing an inappropriate value to the GalSim Position()
function.  Troubleshooting has so far been unsuccessful.  I will continue to work on it.

4. No work on emcee last week.  But Andrew mentioned perhaps meeting today to walk me through it.
