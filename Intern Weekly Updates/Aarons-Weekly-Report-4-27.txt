More progress has been made on the GalSim code, which is now saved as Simulator.ipynb in the 
/python/anb folder on the repository.

The code reads general observational parameters from a text file:  image size [pixels], image center
[RA DEC], pixel scale [arcsec/pixel], and background flux [ADU/pixel].  As Todd pointed out, the
background flux will vary with each frame, so perhaps this should not be a general observational
parameter.  We will need to simulate a changing background flux.

The object parameters have been split into two separate files:  a CSV file containing the 
parameters of unchanging reference objects (the lensing galaxy, APASS stars, etc.), and a CSV file
containing the objects with varying flux (the quasar images).

The object parameter files have been modified as follows:

	Instead of listing every possible profile parameter by name, three generic parameters are
	listed (par_1, par_2, par_3), and these are interpreted by the code in light of the relevant
	profile.  For example, for a Moffat profile par_1=beta, par_2=FWHM, par_3=half light radius.
	These parameters will be different for a Gaussian profile, etc.  Documentation will specify the
	parameters for each profile.  Typically, GalSim requires only 1 of several possible parameters.
	When more than one parameter is entered, the code simply takes the first one and ignores the
	others.
	
	Ellipticity and position angle have been added as parameters.
	
	Flux has been added as a parameter of the reference objects, since these should be unchanging.
	The flux of the quasar images will be read from Chris' simulated light curves.
	
	The reference object file supports Moffat and de Vaucouleur profiles.  More profiles will be
	added today.  The variable object file supports Gaussian and Moffat profiles.  More will be
	added today.
	
The background flux is working.  It is specified as counts/arcsec^2.

Still to do:

     1. Add additional profile types [Sersic, etc.] and their required parameters.
     2. Locate objects by their full coordinates instead of their relative coordinates.
     3. Integrate the output from Chris' light-curve simulations.
     4. Simulate the changing background flux.
