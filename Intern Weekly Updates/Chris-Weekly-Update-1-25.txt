This memo will provide an update to the work I have completed thus far in my first week. It has been a good first week at JPL and I have begun to settle in nicely. This first week mostly comprised of me installing software onto my computer as well as reading documentation and papers relevant to our project. I have installed Anaconda to use Python on my computer but have not started working with any code myself. 
In this first week I have gone through some tutorials on Lynda.com to better familiarize myself with Python and the syntax used. This has helped me better understand what to expect when reading the documentation for packages such as astropy1 and pythonphot2. I have also begun reading a few papers to introduce myself to nomenclature and terminology used. So far I have read through the following papers: Representations of World Coordinates in FITS3, Representations of Distortions in FITS World Coordinate Systems4, emcee: The MCMC Hammer5, COSMOGRAIL: Measuring Time Delays of Gravitationally Lensed Quasars to Constrain Cosmology6, COSMOGRAIL: the COSmological MOnitoring of GRAvItational Lenses. IX. Time delays, lens dynamics and baryonic fraction in HE 0435-12237.
