Here is a summary of my activities for the past week. Please see the Challenges/Questions section at the bottom.

1. More Git
  * Watched "Git for Ages 4 and Up" (a 1hr 40min lecture by Michael Schwern)
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ffBJ4sVUb4
  * Set up fake 'remote' and 'local' repositories on my own machine to practice branching, merging, pulling, pushing, etc.
  * Cloned the lcolens repository
  
2. SAOImage DS9. I've installed this and used it to view some fits images and headers from the repository /data folder.

3. GalSim
  * Installed GalSim (lots of dependencies! not an easy installation!)
  * Used IPython Notebook to begin exploring the GalSim demo scripts
  * Please see my IPython Notebook in the repository /python directory

4. Reading about IPython Notebook
  * http://ipython.org/documentation.html
  * http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/2.x/examples/Index.ipynb
  * http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/notebook/notebook.html

5. Python Reading
  * "The Python Tutorial"
    - https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/

6. Articles
  * Moffat 1969 "A Theoretical Investigation of Focal Stellar Images ..."
  * Hogg & Lang 2012 "Replacing standard galaxy profiles with mixtures of Gaussians"
  * Rowe et al 2014 "GalSim: The modular galaxy image simulation toolkit"

7. Other reading
  * FITS Wikipedia article
  	- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FITS
  * "A Primer on the FITS Data Format"
  	- http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_primer.html

Challenges/Questions:

1. I've looked at the three wcs_corrected.fits images in the /data folder, and I do not know which object is HE0435-1223. The fk5 coordinates that I found here: http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=HE%200435-1223 correspond to nothing in the images. So I don't know the shape of the image that we are trying to profile.

2. Before I try out a Sersic galaxy profile and a Moffat PSF profile in GalSim, I need to research the parameters for the GalSim functions: For example, for the Moffat profile I need a slope parameter beta, and one of the following size parameters: scale_radius, fwhm, or half_light_radius. I don't know reasonable values for these parameters. I will look for them.
