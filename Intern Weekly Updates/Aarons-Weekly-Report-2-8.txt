TO: LEONIDAS MOUSTAKAS
FROM: AARON BUNCH
SUBJECT: WEEKLY REPORT (2/2-2/8)
DATE: FEBRUARY 9, 2015
CC: ANDREW ROMERO-WOLF

Here is a summary of my activities for the past week.

1. GalSim
  * I have updated GalSim_Demo1.ipynb in the repo /python directory with my latest
    explorations.
  * I plotted various Moffat PSF profiles, but they do not look very different from the
    Gaussians.
  * When I try to plot various Sersic galaxy profiles, I get only noise.

2. emcee
  * I am looking for emcee tutorials ...
  * These astrobites summaries are helpful:
    - http://astrobites.com/2011/11/26/your-gateway-to-the-bayesian-realm/
    - http://astrobites.com/2011/07/26/astrostatistics-how-to-fit-a-model-to- data/
    - http://astrobites.com/2012/02/20/code-you-can-use-the-mcmc-hammer/
  * There are some emcee examples here:
    - http://pyspeckit.bitbucket.org/html/sphinx/example_pymc.html
    - http://users.obs.carnegiescience.edu/cburns/ipynbs/Emcee.html
    - http://dan.iel.fm/emcee/current/user/quickstart/
  * I am working through the following articles:
    - "emcee: The MCMC Hammer", Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013
    - "An Introduction to MCMC for Machine Learning", Andrieu et al. 2003
    - "Data analysis recipes: Fitting a model to data", Hogg et al. 2010
  * This book has a chapter on Bayesian analysis and Monte Carlo modeling, but I do not
    have the book yet:
    - Practical Statistics for Astronomers (Cambridge Observing Handbooks for Research
      Astronomers), Wall & Jenkins, 2012

Challenges:

1. As I mentioned above, I am having trouble with the Sersic profiles. I get only noise.
   I will look at Image_generation_test.ipynb in the repo /python directory.

2. emcee is very challenging. I have some qualitative understanding of it. But I do not
   understand the mathematical details. I will continue to read background material and
   study code samples.
