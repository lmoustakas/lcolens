As we discussed last Wednesday, I'll focus on modeling our field with GalSim.  The first obstacle
has been overcome this week:  I finally figured out how to plot multiple objects in a single frame.

I had been trying to create and place 'stamps' (smaller images) within a larger image.  But the
stamps are not transparent, so when they overlap, the top stamp cuts a square corner out of the
bottom stamp.  Lesson:  Stamps can be used to model non-overlapping objects, but they cannot be used
to model our quad-lensed quasar or other objects in crowded fields.

To model overlapping objects, you simply create two objects (one offset or shifted) and then add
them together.  For example:

# create a galaxy profile, gal_1
# create a second galaxy profile, gal_2, with shift (dx,dy)
# add them together:  gal_final = gal_1 + gal_2
# draw the image, gal_final

No stamps are involved in this process.

To convolve these galaxy profiles with PSFs, you simple add the PSFs in the same way:

# create psf_1 for gal_1
# create psf_2 for gal_2 with shift (dx,dy)
# add them together:  psf_final = psf_1 + psf_2

Before drawing the image, convolve the galaxy profiles with the PSFs.

# convolve gal_final, psf_final
# draw the image

THE NEXT STEP: place objects precisely according to WCS coordinates that have been read from a file.
