Here is a summary of my activities for the past week.

1. GalSim

I have been trying (so far unsuccessfully) to create a FITS image with multiple objects in a single
frame.  But none of the GalSim demo scripts seem to do this.  GalSim demo4.py creates multiple
frames in a FITS image cube.  But each frame in the cube contains only one object.  I can easily
browse through the frames, one after another, but I cannot view several objects at the same time
in one frame.

GalSim demo5.py produces a tiled image, where each tile contains one object.  So, for instance, I
can create a 10 x 10 tiled image with an object located at some position in each of these tiles.
Like a quilt with a different picture stitched in each square.  But I do not see how to create a 
crowded field this way, since (as far as I can tell) the tiles do not overlap, so the objects are 
all in their distinct regions.

Other GalSim demo files use this same tiling strategy to create images with multiple objects.

I continue to study the sources I gathered last week concerning Bayesian analysis and Markov Chain
Monte Carlo.  In particular, I am reading _Practical Statistics for Astronomers_ (Wall and Jenkins,
2012), which has introductions to these topics.
