FROM: AARON BUNCH
SUBJECT: WEEKLY REPORT (3/23 - 3/30)
DATE: MARCH 30, 2015
CC: ANDREW ROMERO-WOLF

Last week's goal:  Write a script to read object locations and fluxes from a file and use GalSim to
plot these objects in a single frame.

Accomplishments:  I have a script that takes object locations in RA/DEC and fluxes from a list (not 
from a file), and plots a Gaussian profile at each point in a single frame.  This code is saved as 
an IPython Notebook, GalSim_Aaron_2.ipynb, in the /python folder on the repository.

Challenges:  I thought translating from RA/DEC to pixel coordinates would be difficult.  But it 
turned out to be unnecessary.  GalSim locates objects in terms of arcseconds from the center of the
image.  It then converts this to pixels when it draws the image.  So I set the center equal to some
RA/DEC coordinates in decimal degrees.  Then the shift to the object location is calculated as:
dRA = center_RA - object_RA; dDEC = center_DEC - object_DEC.  The pixel conversion is automatic
when GalSim draws the image.

I found a convenient python package, astrolib.coords, which converts RA/DEC as a string, e.g. 
'04:38:14.786 -12:17:14.91', to decimal degrees.  Although it seems that Chris's function will 
return locations in decimal degrees, so this conversion may not be necessary in future 
implementations.

New goals for this week:

	1. Finish writing and submit my Project Proposal to the Education Office.
	2. In the code from last week, populate the list of object parameters by reading from an ascii
	   file.
	3. Use actual locations of HE0435-1223 and APASS stars in our field.
	3. Increase the number of object parameters to include profile types and parameters (e.g., 
	   Moffat, Sersic, Exponential, etc., alpha, beta, FWHM, etc.)
	4. Coordinate with Chris to integrate his light-curve simulation data.
