SUBJECT: WEEKLY REPORT (5/18 - 5/25)
DATE: May 25, 2015
CC: ANDREW ROMERO-WOLF

In the past week I resolved the following problems:

	a. I corrected the magnitude-to-counts function.  Now it just uses the formula:
	   counts = 10**(-0.4*(m - m0)), where m is the magnitude and m0 is the zero point.
	   
	b. The exposure time is now read from the general observational parameters file.
	   (It had been hard-coded.)
	
	c. The names of the quasar images are no longer hard-coded.  However, the names of the objects
	   in the object parameter files must correspond to the names of the objects in the light-curve
	   table.
	   
	d. I've been trouble-shooting the 'Too many files open' error.  The error arises when I try to
	   save the FITS images as PNG files.  I can save about 190 of them, and then 'too many open'.
	   I still have not solved this problem.
	
My internship ends on June 2, and my final presentation and report are due on Monday, June 1.
During this last week, I will work on the following:

    a. Complete the final report for the Education Office and for the faculty at Citrus College.
    
    b. Prepare slides for the presentation on June 1.
    
    c. Resolve the 'Too many files open' error.
    
    d. Include sky orientation as a variable in the observational parameters file.
    
    e. Look into noise that can be added to the object (in addition to the background noise).
    
    f. Review the code with Andrew and Curtis.
