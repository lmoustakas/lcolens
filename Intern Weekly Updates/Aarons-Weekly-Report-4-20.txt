Good progress has been made on the GalSim code.  The code is saved as GalSim_Aaron_2.ipynb 
in the /python/anb folder on the repository.

The code reads general observational parameters from a text file:  image size [pixels], image center
[RA DEC], pixel scale [arcsec/pixel], and background flux [ADU/pixel].

The code reads object parameters from a CSV file.  The CSV file currently specifies the object
name, object coordinates [RA DEC], profile type [currently only Moffat], and Moffat parameters
beta and FWHM.

Still to do:

     1. Fix the background flux setting; it is not working.
     2. Add ellipticity and rotation parameters to the object parameters file.
     3. Add additional profile types [Sersic, de Vaucouleurs] and their required parameters.
     4. Integrate the output from Chris' light-curve simulations.
