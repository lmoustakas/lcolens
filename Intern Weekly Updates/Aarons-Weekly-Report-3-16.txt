This past week I have been uncertain about how to contribute directly to our project.  I was present
at the coding-push on Friday, but could not find a way to contribute to it.  I had started the week
focused on Bayesian likelihood functions, so that I might be able to drop the functions that Andrew
develops into emcee to estimate the uncertainties.  I can still try to do that.

I know that we also want to estimate the background noise differently than Andrew has done so far.
I have studied Andrew's code to understand how he initially estimated the background noise.  On the
side (I know it is a small fraction of the total noise), I have continued to read about CCD noise.
I found a very helpful article here:  http://www.ucolick.org/~bolte/AY257/s_n.pdf

It has also been mentioned that I should help with using GalSim to fit the quasar and nearby stars.
I re-read the GalSim article (Rowe et al., 2014) to better understand the various coordinate systems
GalSim uses and how to convert from one to another (e.g., from WCS to pixels, and back).

Finally, I have been learning how to use SAO DS9.  Astrobites has a nice introduction here:

And there is a User's Manual and a Reference Manual, which I have begun to look through.
