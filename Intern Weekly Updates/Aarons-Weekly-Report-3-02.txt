In the past week I focused on the emcee python package.  I did not work on GalSim.

UPDATE:  Made lots of progress today (Monday, 3/2).  Not so lost.  This lecture was very helpful:

1. I understand emcee much better after re-reading the emcee "quickstart" example
(http://dan.iel.fm/emcee/current/user/quickstart/) and the paper "emcee: The MCMC Hammer" by
Foreman-Mackey et al.  I went through the sample code line-by-line and looked up the numpy functions
as necessary.  In the context of Bayesian analysis, am I right that the multi-dimensional Gaussian
sampled in this example is the likelihood function?  I would like to talk to someone about how to
interpret x, mu, and Sigma in this formula.  (I know they represent the observation, mean, and
covariance matrices.)  Do they relate to the data, signal and noise?

2. During our Wednesday meeting it was decided that I should study the noise in the data as a step
towards formulating a likelihood function.  I have read in detail about photon noise, dark noise,
and read noise, and how they are added (in quadrature).  I am still uncertain how to formulate a
likelihood function from these noise formulas.

3. On Friday Andrew asked me to prepare a couple of slides for Wednesday about a possible
likelihood function.  Curtis said that the ipython notebook he recently posted (which calculates
and plots the double integral of a Moffat function) would be relevant to this, so I have studied it
-- but so far I do not understand how it helps me.  I am looking for examples of likelihood
functions to guide me.  On Wikipedia I found a log likelihood function for a multi-dimensional
Gaussian which contains some familiar terms, but also some unfamiliar ones.  It is still not clear
how these formulas relate to the sources of noise.

A sampling of on-line sources about noise (some of them are about microscopy, but the principles
seem to be the same):
