SUBJECT: WEEKLY REPORT (4/7 - 4/13)

All of last week I was in Huntsville, AL for the NASA Student Launch at Marshall Space Flight
Center.  The program of events kept us very busy, and little progress was made on the GalSim code
I am developing.

I did write a Progress Report for the Eduction Office, which details my activities since the
beginning of the internship period.

This week is Spring Break at Citrus College.  With the extra time, I expect to make good progress on
the GalSim code!
