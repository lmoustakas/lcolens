TO: LEONIDAS MOUSTAKAS
FROM: AARON BUNCH
SUBJECT: WEEKLY REPORT (3/30 - 4/7)
DATE: APRIL 7, 2015
CC: ANDREW ROMERO-WOLF

In the last week I completed my Project Plan for the Education Office.  That plan benefitted from
the conversation with Leonidas and Chris after the lecture in the 321 auditorium.  In particular,
it made clear that the image simulation need only focus on a small area surrounding our quasar,
and not on the entire field of objects.

In addition to the Project Plan, I owe the Education Office a progress report on my activities
since the beginning of the internship.  I will submit that report this week, and continue to work on
the code for the image simulator.

I am in Huntsville, Alabama all week for the NASA Student Launch at Marshall Space Flight Center.
I will be back at JPL on Monday 4/13.
