This past week was an administrative week where I completed my project plan and began working on my first progress report for the education office. I will be finishing up my progress report by the end of the week.

I have also continued looking into the generating time delays and have begun reading the two papers Andrew suggested. I am working on a way to convert the existing scripts into a usable python notebook for future use.
