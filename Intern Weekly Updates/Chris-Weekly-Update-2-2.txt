This past week I started working with various programs and analyzed the code Andrew had posted to get images to display. I also installed SAOImage DS9 to look at the header information for our FITS file images so I could call them using python.
The integration times are worth analyzing to make sure no anomalies are present for over/under exposure times. I began using UTSTART and UTSTOP to calculate RMS integration times. I have not analyzed all of the data files from nisus yet, but the first three FITS files had a deviation less than .1s.
I was originally working with python 3.4 and am in the process of converting my system back to 2.7. There are a few dependency issues that are still cropping up that prevent me from running scripts. I should have this resolved soon and will then begin working with the files stored on nisus.
