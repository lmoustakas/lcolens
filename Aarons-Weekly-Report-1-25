Although I do not have access to the JPL campus until Feb 17, I plan to work on the lcolens project from home until then. My work for the past week is summarized as follows:

1. git
  * Created Github account
  * Installed git and 'Github for Mac'
  * Read online tutorials about Github basics/workflow
    - https://guides.github.com/
    - http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control
    - http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/

2. python
  * Installed Anaconda 2.7

3. articles
  * F. Courbin et al, A&A 536, A53 (2011): COSMOGRAIL IX. Time delays, lens dynamics and baryonic fraction in HE 0435-1223
  * To understand the Courbin article, I read up on the following topics in Wikipedia (!):
    - standard candle
    - seeing
    - deconvolution
    - point spread functions

4. questions
  * Is there a specific format you would prefer for these weekly updates?
  * Will we be using python 2.7 or 3.4, or both?
